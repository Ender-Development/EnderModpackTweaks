# Ender's Modpack Tweaks

This is a collection of tweaks and changes for the modpacks I'm working on. I will be adding more as I go along. Now
that I'm somewhat comfortable writing mods, I don't have to rely on other mods to make the changes I want. Each feature
can be enabled or disabled in the config file, so you can pick and choose what features you need for your own modpack.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.
