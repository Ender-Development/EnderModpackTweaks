# Ender's Modpack Tweaks

This is a collection of tweaks and changes for the modpacks I'm working on. I will be adding more as I go along. Now that I'm somewhat comfortable with writing mods, I don't have to rely on other mods to make the changes I want. Each feature can be enabled or disabled in the config file. So you can pick and choose what features you need for your own modpack.
If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.

##  Possible Features

- ðŸ”³ adapting [PerfectSpawn](https://github.com/lumien231/Perfect-Spawn)
  - the mod is ancient and not maintained anymore
  - the way to configure it is not user-friendly as it doesn't generate a default config file and the file isn't placed in the config folder, but in the main directory or world save directory instead
  - is uses ASM to modify the spawn code, which is not ideal, when it comes to compatibility
- âœ… adapting [Dragon Murder](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragon-murder)
  - the mod is ancient and not maintained anymore
  - it lacks in config options and doesn't fit my needs
